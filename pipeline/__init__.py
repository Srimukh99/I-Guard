"""Pipeline package for the Iâ€‘Guard project.

The pipeline ties together the various components of the system
including camera adapters, ring buffers, event queues and the
inference coordinator.  It provides the entry point for the
``InferencePipeline`` class and related helpers used by
``app.py`` and the web UI.
