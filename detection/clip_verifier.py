"""Secondary verification stage (clip-based).

The second stage of the ThreatDetect pipeline analyses candidate events
produced by :class:`detection.frame_detector.FrameDetector`. It inspects a short
video clip around the trigger frame (typically 10 seconds before and
10 seconds after) with a more accurate model to determine whether the
event truly represents a weapon or violent behaviour. This reduces
false alarms and improves confidence before escalating to human
review or auto-response.

This module provides :class:`ClipVerifier`, a thin wrapper that loads
an ONNX or TensorRT model and exposes a simple :meth:`verify` method.
For demonstration purposes the implementation below simply counts how
many frames in the clip contain a weapon detection from Step 1; if more
than half contain a weapon, the verifier returns a high score. In a
real system you would replace this logic with a proper video action
classifier (e.g. SlowFast, TimeSformer or a 3D CNN).

        The verifier expects an iterable of detection label lists, one list
        per frame in the clip. It computes a simple weapon ratio: the
        fraction of frames containing at least one weapon label. If this
        ratio exceeds the configured threshold, the event is considered
        verified.

        ----------
        detections_per_frame : Iterable[List[str]]
            For each frame, a list of labels predicted by Step 1 (e.g.
            ["gun", "person"]). This information should be extracted from
            the recorded clip.

        -------
        Dict[str, float]
